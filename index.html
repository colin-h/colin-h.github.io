            <p style="text-indent: 5em;">I was born in Houston, Texas. The trees were tall and green. The air was always heavy. There was a tall bridge behind our neighborhood. I remember my friend Ben and I going and peering over its edges, pretending to see beasts swimming in the brown waters below. I moved to Austin, Texas in the 7th grade. On the first day of school I walked up to a stranger because I overheard him talking about a video game I liked to play.
             The next two years he introduced me to more friends and we would play video games at my house because my parents slept on the 2nd floor.</p>
             <p style="text-indent: 5em;">In high school, I joined the football team. I remember driving to school in the quiet of the early morning and grumbling as I slid into my mildewy pads. We ran until we collapsed. And then we ran some more. The first few years of college I hardly slept. There was an endless stream of people who wanted to do things. Swim in the lake at night. Write music. Talk. I often forgot names. I picked the guitar back up during this time for although the onset of college is bright and exciting,
              it can also be deeply lonesome. Music helped me be sad and consequently, happy.</p>
